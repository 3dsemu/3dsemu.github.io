<strong>About 3DSemu</strong>
<br />
<br />
<p>3DSemu is one of the few Nintendo 3DS emulators. It was previously open-source, but</p>
<p>it is now closed-source. A small team of talented developers are now releasing updates</p>
<p>to 3DSemu. The emulator can run both homebrew and commercial games at full speed. There</p>
<p>have been no reports of crashes so far. 3DSemu also has actual 3D support and WiFi support</p>
<p>Best of all, 3DSemu is free! Yep, this emulator is 100% free!</p>
